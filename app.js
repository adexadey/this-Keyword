// ● What is the value of the keyword this in the following example:

var data = this ;
console.log(data); // Window Object


// ● What does this function output? Why?
function logThis (){
return this ;
}
logThis(); // Window Object becasue it's still global execution context

// ● What does this function output? Why?
var instructor = {
		firstName : 'Tim' ,
		sayHi : function (){
		console.log( "Hello! " + this .firstName);
	}
}
instructor.sayHi() // Hello! Tim because it's implicit Object i.e immediate parent


// ● What does this function output? Why?
var instructor = {
	firstName : 'Tim' ,
	info : {
		catOwner : true ,
		boatOwner : true
	},
	displayInfo : function (){
		console.log( "Cat owner? " + this .catOwner);
	}
}

instructor.displayInfo() // Cat owners? undefined because in this.catOwner (catOwner isn't available on the implicit Object)


// ● What does this function output? Why?
var instructor = {
	firstName : 'Tim' ,
	info : {
		catOwner : true ,
		boatOwner : true ,
		displayLocation : function (){
		return this .data.location;
		},
		data : {
			location : "Oakland"
		}
	}
}
instructor.info.displayLocation() // Oakland (implicit)


// ● What does this function output? Why?
var instructor = {
	firstName : 'Tim' ,
	info : {
		catOwner : true ,
		boatOwner : true ,
		displayLocation : function (){
			return this.location;
		},
		data : {
			location : "Oakland" ,
			logLocation : this.displayLocation
		}
	}
}
instructor.info.data.logLocation() // logLocation isn't a function Why might we be getting an error here?

/* ======== Part 2 ========= */
// Call Apply Bind Exercises
// Fix the following code:
var obj = {
fullName : "Harry Potter" ,
person : {
sayHi : function (){
return "This person's name is " + this. fullName
}
}
}
● List two examples of "array-like-objects" that we
have seen.
○
Functions to write:
Make the tests pass for the following functions:
● Write a function called sumEvenArguments which takes all of the arguments
passed to a function and returns the sum of the even ones.
sumEvenArguments ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) // 6
sumEvenArguments ( 1 , 2 , 6 ) // 8
sumEvenArguments ( 1 , 2 ) // 2
● Write a function called arrayFrom which converts an array-like-object into an
array.
function sample (){
var arr = arrayFrom (arguments)
if (!arr. reduce ) throw "This is not an array!"
return arr. reduce ( function (acc,next){
return acc + next;
}, 0 )
}
Write a function called invokeMax which accepts a function and a maximum amount.
invokeMax should return a function that when called increments a counter. If the
counter is greater than the maximum amount, the inner function should return
"Maxed Out!"
function add (a,b){
return a + b
}
var addOnlyThreeTimes = invokeMax (add, 3 );
addOnlyThreeTimes( 1 , 2 ) // 3
addOnlyThreeTimes( 2 , 2 ) // 4
addOnlyThreeTimes( 1 , 2 ) // 3
addOnlyThreeTimes( 1 , 2 ) // "Maxed Out!"
Write a function called guessingGame which takes in one parameter amount . The
function should return another function that takes in a parameter called guess . In the
outer function, you should create a variable called answer which is the result of a
random number between 0 and 10 as well as a variable called guesses which should
be set to 0.
In the inner function, if the guess passed in is the same as the random number
(defined in the outer function) - you should return the string "You got it!". If the guess
is too high return "You're too high!" and if it is too low, return "You're too low!". You
should stop the user from guessing if the amount of guesses they have made is
greater than the initial amount passed to the outer function.
You will have to make use of closure to solve this problem.
var game = guessingGame ( 5 )
game( 1 ) // "You're too low!"
game( 8 ) // "You're too high!"
game( 5 ) // "You're too low!"
game( 7 ) // "You got it!"
game( 1 ) // "You are all done playing!"
var game2 = guessingGame ( 3 )
game2( 5 ) // "You're too low!"
game2( 3 ) // "You're too low!"
game2( 1 ) // "No more guesses the answer was 0"
game2( 1 ) // "You are all done playing!"
